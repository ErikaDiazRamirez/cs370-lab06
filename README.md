# cs370-lab06

to run this program:
1. git clone it into a directory of your choice
2. run the .uproject and let it rebuild
3. once rebuilt you should be able to play

things to note:
1. getting boo to reappear is weird, the only consistent way that we have found to make it appear is to spawn in and look directly to the right. then look back at the box and he will be there.
2. if boo is invisible and infront of the red cube before you interact with it, the red cube may not dissapear
